### Merge Sort

- We use sorts to preorganize the data.
- This makes it faster.

### These sort methods are not ideal:
#### Insertion Sort
- It puts the numbers in the correct location within the array.
- In-place, and stable
- o(n^2)
#### Selection Sort
#### Bubble Sort

### These sort methods are ideal:
#### Quick Sort
#### Merge Sort
- First, you divide the data in half
7, 1, 3, 5 / 9, 4, 8
- You repeatedly divide it in half until all data is divided. (i.e. numbers are by themselves)
- You then crawl back up, compare, and merge as your progress back
- NOT in-place, but is stable

#### Divide and Conquer
- Dividing the problem by halves multiple times in order to solve it more easily.

In-place = o(1) input space
Stable = like values maintain a relative location
